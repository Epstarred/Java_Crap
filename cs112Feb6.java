// The This Keyword
// Two cases: We have constructors and they are overloaded
// One where it takes input, and one where it doesn't.
// We use the "this" to call the constructor for the correct type. i.e. this(i5) calls the INTS one.
//This refers to THIS OBJECT that we are calling the constructor on.
